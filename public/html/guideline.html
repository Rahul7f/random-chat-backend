                        <li>strangerchat.fun is not a dating platform. Sending unsolicited sexual advances may lead to a

                        </li>
                        <li>Do not ask other users to add you on other platforms without a meaningful reason. This

                    <p>Account suspensions can be removed through a <strong>successful appeal</strong>, but only if you
                        believe that we took the wrong action. There is no point asking to be appealed for breaking the
                        law.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to appeal a suspension, please contact <a href="mailto:help@strangerchat.fun">help@strangerchat.fun</a>.
