                        <h3 id="hcaptcha">hCaptcha</h3>
                        <p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter “hCaptcha”) on our website. This service is
                            provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation (“IMI”). hCaptcha is used to
                            check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has
                            been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the
                            behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This
                            analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of
                            the website or app with hCaptcha enabled.</p>
                        <p>When using the&nbsp;<a href="https://strangerchat.fun">strangerchat.fun</a>, hCaptcha will only begin
                            analysis when you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Submit a login request.</li>
                            <li>Submit a registration request.</li>
                            <li>Submit a password request / email resend request.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the
                            visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data
                            collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI.</p>
                        <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app
                            operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling
                            and spam. IMI acts as a “data processor” acting on behalf of its customers as defined under
                            the GDPR, and a “service provider” for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act
                            (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI’s privacy policy and terms of use,
